Explore [ClimaScale](https://climascale.vercel.app//) and discover its features.

## Conceptual Genesis
The genesis of ClimaScale was fueled by the general populace's limited self-awareness regarding their individual contributions to carbon emissions.

## Functionality Overview
**ClimaScale** is engineered to process user-provided data and compute an estimated monthly carbon footprint. The output page delineates the user's annual carbon footprint and contextualizes it by juxtaposing it against various global benchmarks, encompassing low, average, and high emission metrics per capita.

## Development Framework
The development of **ClimaScale** was executed utilizing an array of technologies including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. Key integrations comprised React-Icons, React-Router, and a custom ContextProvider React Hook. Additionally, ChatGPT was employed to generate a comprehensive data object for calculating carbon emissions from diverse sources.

## Technical Challenges
- The project encountered complexities in reconciling disparate measurement systems for carbon emissions (Lbs, Tons, etc.).

## Milestones Achieved
- Successful creation of a fully operational application within a constrained timeframe.
- Establishment and maintenance of an efficient GitHub workflow.
- Effective collaboration within a five-developer team, fostering shared communication and learning experiences.

## Knowledge Gained
- In-depth understanding of carbon footprint metrics and their significance.
- Strategies for reducing carbon emissions through incremental lifestyle adjustments.

## Future Directions for ClimaScale
- Integration of a backend system to facilitate data storage, user accounts, and interactive user engagement.
- Development of an API to further enhance the application's capabilities.
